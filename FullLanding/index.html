				Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
				1500s,

				when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
				type specimen book.

				It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into

				It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets

				including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
